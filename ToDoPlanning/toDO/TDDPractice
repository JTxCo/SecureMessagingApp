Task: Send Message

Unit tests: 
    Given we create a messaging service, when we call the function to send a message, then the message is sent to the recipient
    //To get test to compile
        //Create the function to send a message
        //Type out a message to be sent to another user
    //To get test to pass    
        //Send the message
        //Return true when the message was sent successfully


    
    
    sender = user1
    recipient = user2
    message = "message to be sent"

    sentMessage = messageService(sender, recipient, message) 

    assertEqual(sentMessage, "message sent")
