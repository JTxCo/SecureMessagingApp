# SecureMessagingApp
This project implements a peer-to-peer chat application, created using React Native, designed for optimized security and user interaction. It adopts cryptographic techniques to preserve the confidentiality and authenticate the integrity of the messages exchanged. The application grants users the ability to register, log in, engage in private or group chats, and modify their personal settings.
The application architecture employs Redux for robust and consistent state management and React Navigation for a seamless navigation experience between different screens. The application leverages two local databases, SQLite and AsyncStorage, to manage and preserve the different characteristics of data.
SQLite, a SQL-based relational database, holds tables for user accounts, individual and group chats. The 'users' table comprises data like usernames, hashed passwords, and individualised settings. The 'chats' table associates user IDs with their corresponding message data and timestamps. The 'groups' table governs group chat data, including user IDs of the group members and shared messages. Each message, regardless of whether it belongs to a private or a group chat, is encrypted before being stored to preserve user confidentiality.
On the other side, AsyncStorage, a simplified key-value storage system, caters to the management of less complex, yet frequently accessed data. Session tokens for user authentication, for instance, are stored and retrieved for each user interaction with the application. Similarly, user personal settings such as preferred language or theme, are also stored via AsyncStorage for expedited access.
The interactions between these two databases are governed by an efficient strategy for data storage and retrieval, enabling a user experience that is seamless and engaging. Through the combined use of SQL-based and key-value databases for diverse data requisites, the application achieves a harmony in managing the varying complexities of real-time, secure messaging in a mobile environment. The application's architecture is modular, promoting easier maintenance, and continuous enhancements while adhering to top-notch coding practices.
